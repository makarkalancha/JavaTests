//    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_word_in_English

//    Major dictionaries
//    The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is
// pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted
// from the inhalation of very fine silica particles,[8] specifically from a volcano; medically, it
// is the same as silicosis. The word was deliberately coined to be the longest word in English,
// and has since been used in a close approximation of its originally intended meaning, lending at
// least some degree of validity to its claim.
