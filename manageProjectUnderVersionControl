Directory based project format (.idea directory)

This format is used by all the recent IDE versions by default. Here is what you need to share:

    All the files under .idea directory in the project root except the workspace.xml and tasks.xml files which store user specific settings
    All the .iml module files that can be located in different module directories (applies to IntelliJ IDEA)

Be careful about sharing the following:

    Android artifacts that produce a signed build (will contain keystore passwords)
    In IDEA 13 and earlier dataSources.ids, datasources.xml can contain database passwords. IDEA 14 solves this problem.
